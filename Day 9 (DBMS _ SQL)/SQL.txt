RDBMS Vendors like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server,...
	->provide their own implementation of SQL
	-> Orcale ->PL/SQL
	-> SQL Server -> T- SQL
	-> Built-in functions differ across RDBMS vendors

Every statement taht is excuted fillows a pattern:
Query engine
	- parses the query for syntax
	- resolves the objects that are used by the query [ SYSTEMS.customers ]
	- optimization of thew query [ generates the execution plan ] - cheapest way
	- Completes the query  - generates instructions to extract the data from the files.
	- executes the instructions.
Storage Engine
 	- FileManager - manages all the physical files in DB
	- MemoryManager- manages the heap/cache
	- ThreadManager/ResourceManagers
	- TransactionManager - Unit-of-Work ID (UoW)
